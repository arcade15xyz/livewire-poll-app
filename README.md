# LIVEWIRE-POLLS-APP

## Starting

ðŸš€. Make a Laravel Project using  
 `laravel new example-app`
ðŸš€. Now to install **Livewire**
`composer require livewire/livewire`
ðŸš€. We need to use the following Assets (directives):

> a. **@livewireStyles**: Styles from livewire.
> b. **@livewireScript**: JavaScripts returns. Helps in communication with the backend using livewire.
> _Read more about these from doucmentations_

**Important Error**: always do migrations in the flow the relations are made else on migrating in group don't work. In such cases we need to do the migrations seprately for each model.

```
php artisan make:migration create_polls_table

php artisan make:migration create_options_table

php artisan make:migration create_votes_table
```

## First Livewire component (CreatePoll.php)

```
php artisan make:livewire CreatePoll
```

The above command basically create a file named `app/Livewire/CreatePoll.php` and also a component in `resources/views/livewire/create-poll.blade.php`. So now we need to this component in `app.blade.php ` like this

```php
  @livewire('create-poll')
```

The whole file must look like this `app.blade.php`:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Laravel Livewire Poll</title>

  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

  {{-- blade-formatter-disable --}}
  <style type="text/tailwindcss">
    .btn {
      @apply rounded-md px-2 py-1 text-center font-medium text-slate-700 shadow-sm ring-1 ring-slate-700/10 hover:bg-slate-50
    }

    label {
      @apply block uppercase text-slate-700 mb-2
    }

    input,
    textarea {
      @apply shadow-sm appearance-none border w-full py-2 px-3 text-slate-700 leading-tight focus:outline-none
    }

    .error {
      @apply text-red-500 text-sm
    }
  </style>
  {{-- blade-formatter-enable --}}

  @livewireStyles
</head>

<body class="container mx-auto mt-10 mb-10 max-w-lg">
  @livewireScripts

  @livewire('create-poll')
</body>

</html>

```

and there is need for `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts` these helps us in maintaining styles and with scripting (dynamic) like in `javascript` `react` etc. So what I learned is **livewire** helps in fuctionality like `javascript` without need for that.  
now lets see in the _Component_ file `create-poll.blade.php` here we define the component code like:

```php
<div>
    <form>
        <label>Poll Title</label>

        <input type="text" wire:model.live="title">

        Current title: {{ $title }}
    </form>
</div>

```

`wire:model.live` help us with dynamic functioning. in Livewire 3, wire:model is "deferred" by default (instead of by wire:model.defer). To achieve the same behavior as wire:model from Livewire 2, you must use wire:model.live.

## Actions in Livewire

[To know more about _Actions_ CLICK](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/actions)

What I learned is simply that **Actions** helps us apply some action in the browser. First we need to define that action in `CreatePoll.php` like

```php
    public function addOption()
    {
        $this->options[] = '';
    }
```

What this action does is it simply append the `''` in the `options`.  
and to apply this

```php
    <div class="mt-4">
        <button class="btn" wire:click.prevent = "addOption">Add Option</button>
    </div>
```

we use prevent as its in _form_ so by default _button_ does _submit_ so we are preventing it.

## Editing Poll Options

So now we are Editing Options and its simple. We will use actions here. Following code is in `@foreach`.

```php
<div class="mb-4">
                    <label for="">Option {{ $index + 1 }}</label>
                    <div class="flex gap-2">
                        <input type="text" wire:model.live = "options.{{ $index }}"/>
                        <button class="btn" wire:click.prevent = "removeOption({{ $index }})">Remove</button>
                    </div>
                </div>
```

so in here we are deleting the _Option_ using button and action namely `removeOption()`.  
Then in the `CreatePoll.php` :

```php
    public function removeOption($index)
    {
        unset($this->options[$index]);
        $this->options = array_values($this->options);
    }
```

`unset()`: deletes the index data fromt he array .
`array_values`: Returns all the values of the array and also rearrage indexes in case some data is deleted.

## Creating a Poll

So to submit the **Poll** we are using _livewire_ first check the _form_ in `create-poll.blade.php` there we are using `wire:submit.prevent = "createPoll"` then the data isn't sent to url as we prevented it and then in `CreatePoll.php`

```php
    public function createPoll()
    {
        $poll = Poll::create([
            'title' => $this->title
        ]);
        foreach ($this->options as $optionName) {
            $poll->options()->create(['name' => $optionName]);
        }

        $this->reset(['title', 'options']);
    }
```

## Refactoring the Poll Storing Code (Another way aka laravel way)

Now we will see another way to store the data but without using a variable (_$poll_).

```php
Poll::create([
    'title' => $this->title
])->options()->createMany(
    collect($this->options)
    ->map(fn($option) => ['name' => $option])
    ->all()
);
```

a. `createMany()` : Create a Collection of new instances of the related model.
a. `collect()` : Create a collection from the given value.
a. `map()` : Run a map over each of the items.
a. `all()` : Get all of the items in the collection. i.e. makes an array.
